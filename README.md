# 🧠 DeepLearning_models

Welcome to the **DeepLearning_models** repository!  
This is the root repository where I organize and maintain a collection of **Deep Learning projects**, each contained in its own modular folder.

> 📌 Currently, the repo contains one active project: **Traffic Sign Recognition (TRS)**.  
> More projects will be added soon.
